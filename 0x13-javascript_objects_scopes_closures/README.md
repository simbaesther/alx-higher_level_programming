Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
Why JavaScript programming is amazing
How to create an object in JavaScript
What this means
What undefined means
Why the variable type and scope is important
What is a closure
What is a prototype
How to inherit an object from another

## Mandatory

1. 0-rectangle.js - Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
2. 1-rectangle.js - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with the attributes for width and height.
3. 2-rectangle.js - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with the attributes for width and height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
4. 3-rectangle.js - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with the attributes for width and height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.
5. 4-rectangle.js - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with the attributes for width and height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X. Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle. Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.
6. 5-square.js - Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js.
7. 6-square.js - Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js. Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c. If c is undefined, use the character X.
8. 7-occurrences.js - Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.
9. 8-esrever.js - Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list.
10. 9-logme.js - Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
11. 10-converter.js - Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.

## Advanced

100-map.js - Write a script that imports an array and computes a new array.
101-sorted.js - Write a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.
102-concat.js - Write a script that concats 2 files.
